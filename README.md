## üéØ About this project
Have you ever imagined that a simple keychain could become the entry point to your most valuable passwords?  
This project demonstrates, in a controlled and educational environment, how **NFC technology combined with social engineering** can be used to simulate a phishing attack.  

The goal is to **raise awareness in cybersecurity** by showing how everyday objects can be weaponized if users are not cautious.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This repository is **strictly for educational purposes**.  
The content presented here must **not** be used for illegal or malicious activities.  
The project is intended to:  
- Teach about **phishing** and **NFC technology**.  
- Show how **social engineering** exploits human trust.  
- Promote **cybersecurity awareness**.

## üîç Theoretical Background  

### üì° NFC (Near Field Communication)  
NFC is a short-range wireless communication technology widely used in:  
- Contactless payments  
- Public transportation cards  
- Smart access systems  
- Everyday objects like keychains  

Its main advantage is **convenience**: just tap and go.  
However, this same ease can be exploited by attackers to deliver malicious links or trigger unwanted actions without the user noticing.

### üé≠ Phishing  
Phishing is a **social engineering technique** where an attacker tricks a victim into voluntarily revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or financial details.  

Typical examples include:  
- Fake login pages that imitate trusted services (e.g., Facebook, Gmail).  
- Emails with urgent or threatening language.  
- Malicious links hidden behind convincing messages.

### üß† Social Engineering  
Unlike traditional hacking, social engineering focuses on **exploiting human trust instead of breaking technology**.  
It leverages curiosity, fear, or urgency to manipulate people into taking unsafe actions.  

In this project, the combination of **NFC + phishing** illustrates how an everyday object (a simple keychain) could be transformed into a deceptive tool to raise awareness of these threats.
